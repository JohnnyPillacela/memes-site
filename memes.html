	<p>Here you will find the most of quality</p>
	<p>MEMES made by the best MEME creators out there. </p>

	<p>Here are some quotes about MEMES by knowledgeable humans</p>
	<hr><br><br>
	<p>“Professor Dawkins himself stated that “Religion is about turning untested belief, into unshakable truth through the power of institutions, and the passage of time.” This is exactly what is happening with his MEME conjecture. He is taking an untestable idea, by scientific standards, and through media and literature and a popular cult following, creating it into a social norm of truth where others believe his idea and propagate it as an unshakeable truth. This also is occurring faster because of computer technology in time. But nonetheless, it is an occurrence within a passage of time.” </p>
	<p>― Idav Kelly, The Leprechaun Delusion</p>
	<hr><br><br>
	<p>“Einstein created an unstoppable "intellectual chain reaction," an avalanche of pulsing, chattering neurons and MEMES that will ring for an eternity” </p>
	<p>― Clifford A. Pickover, The Physics Book: From the Big Bang to Quantum Resurrection, 250 Milestones in the History of Physics</p>
	<hr><br><br>
	<p>“MEMES are dank”<p>
	<p>― Abraham Lincoln</p>
	<hr><br><br>
	<p>When you get into statistical analysis, you don't really expect to achieve fame. Or to become an Internet MEME. Or be parodied by 'The Onion' - or be the subject of a cartoon in 'The New Yorker.' I guess I'm kind of an outlier there.</p>
	<p>Nate Silver</p>
