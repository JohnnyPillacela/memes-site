This meme site was made a couple years ago like late 2017 so memes might be outdated. Either way, the like or dislike feature works only in the shuffle page of the web pages.

Some memes have been deleted and caused some bugs during the shuffle feature.
Everything in these webpages is for jokes and giggles and shouldn't be taken factual especially the quotes.
